# üñºÔ∏è Image Binarization with SIMD Assembly and C#

A Windows desktop application for image binarization using thresholding, built in C#.  
Supports multiple binary processing backends, including **SIMD-optimized assembly routines**, with full multi-threading support.

Developed as a university project focused on performance comparison between **C#**, **assembly (SIMD)**, and **assembly (non-SIMD)** versions.

## üß† About the Project

- Load and binarize bitmap images using a dynamic threshold (0‚Äì255)
- Visual preview and side-by-side comparison of results
- Multiple backends:
  - C# implementation
  - Assembly with SIMD (vector instructions)
  - Assembly without SIMD (educational comparison)
- Adjustable **thread count** (from 1 to 64)
- Real-time **execution time measurement** per backend
- GUI for selecting image and method


## üíª Technologies Used

- C# (Windows Forms)
- Assembly (x64, SIMD SSE)
- Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs)
- .NET Framework
- Multi-threading (thread pool)
- WinForms UI


## üìä Performance

The app was benchmarked using images of different sizes (S, M, L) and varying thread counts.  
Results show significantly better scaling and performance for the C# version vs assembly under multithreading.  
SIMD version offered insight into low-level parallel processing, though performance was bottlenecked by instruction overhead.

**Agata Sobczyk** ‚Äì designed and implemented the entire system independently


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio
2. Make sure `BinarizationAsm.dll` is referenced correctly in `Form1.cs`
3. Load a test image (BMP, JPG or PNG)
4. Select processing method (C#, ASM, ASM-NV)
5. Adjust threshold and number of threads
6. Click to apply and compare results

> Works best in Release mode. Ensure platform target is set to x64.
